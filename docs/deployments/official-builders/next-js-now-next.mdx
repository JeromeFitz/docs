### Next.js (@now/next)

This builder takes a Next.js application, defined as `pages`, `next.config.js` and optionally a `package.json` file (with `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, etc), and converts them into a series of individual [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

It features built-in caching of `node_modules` and all the compiler artifacts for very fast  deployments.

#### When to use it

`@now/next` is the ideal way to ship a fast, production-ready Next.js application that scales automatically.

#### How to use it

Create a `pages` directory with some example pages, for example `pages/index.js`:

```
export default () => (
  <div>
    Hello world!
  </div>
)
```

For this example, we won't define a `package.json` with our dependencies. We'll let the builder automatically install them. We'll create a simple `next.config.js` file to use as our entrypoint for the build

```
module.exports = () => ({})
```

Then we'll define our build step in `now.json`:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next" }
  ]
}
```

Upon deployment, we'll get a URL like this: https://next-js-deployment-kbbzal0ha.now.sh/

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint
The entrypoint of this builder is a `next.config.js` file or a `package.json` file.

##### Dependencies installation
The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

##### Private npm modules
To install private npm modules, define `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

##### Node.js version
The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.
