## Versioning

All endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions vary per endpoint and are not global.

The response shape of a certain endpoint is not guaranteed to be fixed over time. In particular, we might add new keys to responses without bumping a version endpoint, which will be noted in the changelog.

To ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to only read the keys from the response that your application needs. Don't proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation.

Old versions of each endpoint are supported for as long as possible. When we intend to deprecate, we will notify users in the changelog section.

<Example>
  <span>Endpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example, using version <InlineCode>6</InlineCode> of the <GenericLink href="#endpoints/deployments">deployments endpoint</GenericLink>:</span>
  <Code>https://api.zeit.co/v6/now/deployments</Code>
</Example>
