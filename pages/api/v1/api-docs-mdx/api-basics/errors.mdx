## Errors

The possible `error_code` values are documented on a per-endpoint basis in the [Errors](#errors/generic) section.

Since the `message` is bound to change over time, we recommend you do not pass it along directly to end-users of your application.

<Example>
  <span>All errors have the following format:</span>
  <Code>{`{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "An english description of the error that just occurred"
  }
}`}</Code>
</Example>
