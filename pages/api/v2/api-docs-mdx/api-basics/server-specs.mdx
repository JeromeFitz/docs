## Server Specs
### Origins
The Now API serves endpoints from Origin nodes located both in SFO1 (US West) and BRU1 (Brussels, Europe).

Each request to any `api.zeit.co` endpoint, will be automatically resolved to the closest Origin location using Anycast. Allowing requests to be routed this way is the recommended way to use our API.

If requests are desired to hit a certain location, however, the API can be accessed through individual URLs for each Origin. SFO1 can be resolved through `api-sfo1.zeit.co`, and BRU1 can be resolved through `api-bru1.zeit.co`.

### HTTP and TLS
The API supports HTTP versions 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred.

TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are supported, although TLS protocol 1.2 is recommended.

For more information on TLS support, refer to the [SSL Labs report](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=api.zeit.co&hideResults=on&latest).
