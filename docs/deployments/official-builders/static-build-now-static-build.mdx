### Static Build (@now/static-build)
This module takes a Node.js `package.json` file, installs all its dependencies, executes the `now-build` step and exposes the resulting `dist` directory as the [build output](build-output) for serving.

#### When to use it

This Builder is very useful when you have source files that when built will be served **statically**, but instead of pre-building yourself on a developer machine or CI, you want Now to do it in the cloud every time you deploy.

<Note>At the moment, `@now/static-build` only supports build processes that can be expressed using Node.js and npm dependencies.</Note>

#### How to use it

First, decide on a directory where your statically generated site source code will reside. This can be the top level directory or a sub-directory inside a [monorepo](monorepo).

In this example, we will use `@now/static-build` to build two Hugo websites statically.

<TerminalInput>{`mkdir my-app
cd my-app`}</TerminalInput>

Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so that you can use its bootstrapping tools, and run:

<TerminalInput>{`hugo new site docs
hugo new site blog`}</TerminalInput>

Go inside each directory and create a `package.json` file. We can use `yarn` to bootstrap it and also include `hugo` so that Now can build it:

<TerminalInput>
yarn add hugo-cli
</TerminalInput>

Hugo requires that you download and configure a theme. For this example we ran inside `docs` and `blog`:

```
git init;\\
  git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke;\\
  echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
  ```

  And create an example post in both `docs` and `blog`:

  <TerminalInput>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md</TerminalInput>

  Make sure `node_modules` and `dist` are in [`.nowignore`](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths)`

  ```
  node_modules
  ```

  Finally, for Now to know what to execute, add to `package.json`:

  ```
  "scripts": {
    "now-build": "hugo -d dist"
  }
```

Notice that `@now/static-build`:
- Uses `package.json` as a way of getting dependencies and specifying your build
- Will **only execute** your `now-build` script
- Expects the output to go to `dist`

Finally, we tell Now that we want to execute two builds for this deployment:

```
{
  "version": 2,
    "builds": [
    { "src": "docs/package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" },
    { "src": "blog/package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }
    ]
}
```

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint

The `src` of each build you define with `@now/static` must be a `package.json` file.

##### Dependencies installation

The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

##### Private npm modules

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

##### Node.js version

The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.
