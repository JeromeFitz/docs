### Go (@now/go)

This builder takes in a Go program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a [Lambda](/docs/v2/deployment/concepts/lambdas).

#### When to use it

Whenever you want to expose an API or a function written in Go.

#### How to use it

Define a `index.go` file inside a folder as follows:

```
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
)

func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go on Now!</h1>")
}
```

And define a `now.json` like:
```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.go", "use": "@now/go" }
  ]
}
```

Notice that the API is cohesive with the `net/http` Go API. Your main entrypoint function **must be** called `Handler`.

The example above can be seen live from the following URL: https://go-deployment-l78bij0fj.now.sh/

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint

The entrypoint file must be a `.go` source file with a `Handler` function inside implementing the `net/http` API.

##### Version

Go 1.x is used.
