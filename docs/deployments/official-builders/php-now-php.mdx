### PHP (@now/php)

The `@now/php` builder allows you to use any `.php` file.

<Note>This builder will only include one PHP source file per <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas">Lambda</GenericLink>. In the future, it will automatically include its dependencies via static analysis.</Note>

#### When to use it

Whenever you want to use PHP.

##### How to use it

Define a `.php` file:

```
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

And a `now.json` like:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.php", "use": "@now/php" }
  ]
}
```

After running `now`, you'll get a URL like this: https://php-deployment-7z9gyzb8j.now.sh/

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint

The entrypoint file must be a `.php` source file.

##### Global variables

All standard PHP variables like `$_GET`, `$_POST` are supported, with the exception of:

- `$_SESSION`
- `$_FILES`

##### Version

PHP 7 is implemented via the `go-php` package and bundled as a Go binary.
