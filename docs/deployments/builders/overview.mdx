### Overview

Builders are modules that take a deployment's source and return an output, consisting of [either static files or dynamic Lambdas](/builds-source-and-output).

#### When to Use Builders

If your project has source files that require transformation to be served to users, Builders enable this ability when deploying.

Whether [HTML files need to be minified](now/html-minifier), or dynamic content such as a [Node](now/node), [PHP](now/php), or [Go](now/go) app, need to be deployed, Builders offer the [flexibility and availability](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide) needed to reach that goal.

#### How to Use Builders

Builders can be used in with Now by creating a `now.json` file in a project and then [using a `builds` property](/builds-doc) within that configuration:

    {
    	"builds": [
    		{ "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/static" },
    		{ "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" }
    	]
    }

The `builds` property is an array of objects where each object is a build step, including a `src` and a `use` property, at least.

The Builder will receive a list of files based on the `src` property's [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) value.

#### Developing your Own Builder

Extending the feature-set of a Now deployment is as simple as creating a Builder that, as previously mentioned, takes a list of files and outputs either static files or dynamic [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

[A full API reference is available to help with creating Builders.](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide)

#### Technical Details

##### Caching data

A builder can retain an archive of up to `100mb` of the filesystem at `build` time. The cache key is generated as a combination of

- Deployment `name` (i.e.: the app name)
- Team id or user id
- Entrypoint path (e.g.: `api/users/index.go`)
- Builder identifier including version (e.g.: `@now/go@0.0.1`)

The cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. The user can bypass the cache by running `now -f`.

##### Limits

- Builders can run for a maximum of 15 minutes before the execution times out.
- The maximum cache archive size of a Builder is 100mb.
- The cache TTL is 7 days.
