### Static (@now/static)
This module is used to include **source files** as [**Build outputs**](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#source-and-output). You can think of `@now/static` as a module that *copies over* files.

##### When to use it
When you deploy a project that has no [Builds](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) we serve the sources directly.

For example, when you deploy a single file (`now photo.jpg`) or a directory with no `now.json` and/or no `builds` inside it.

However, if you define a build step, Now will only include its outputs in the resulting deployment, as a security precaution to avoid serving unintended files to the public.

In those circumstances, if you want to include unmodified source files as outputs, you can use `@now/static`.

##### How to use it
Suppose you have a directory with three files:

- `function.js` - A Node.js function you want to expose.
- `index.html` - A source file you **want to serve** without modification.
- `README.md` - A source file you **never want to serve**.

If your `now.json` looks like this:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "function.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

Then only the build outputs of `@now/node` will be included: a [lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

To see for yourself, check the resulting deployment [`https://builds-deployment-r33zqy3gu.now.sh`](https://builds-deployment-r33zqy3gu.now.sh) (and inspect its source code and outputs by appending `/_src`:  [`https://builds-deployment-r33zqy3gu.now.sh/_src`](https://builds-deployment-r33zqy3gu.now.sh/_src) ).

To also serve `index.html`, you'll want to add a `@now/static` build:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "function.js", "use": "@now/node" },
    { "src": "index.html", "use": "@now/static" }
  ]
}
```

You can see the resulting deployment in action here: [https://builds-deployment-2d7eouze2.now.sh](https://builds-deployment-2d7eouze2.now.sh)

##### Technical Details

###### Entrypoint

You can specify any file or set of files as the `src` of a build that uses `@now/static`.
