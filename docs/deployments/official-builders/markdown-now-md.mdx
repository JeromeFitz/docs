### Markdown (@now/md)
This builder converts `.md` files into `.html`. It uses [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) under the hood.

#### When to use it
When you want to create quick static websites from Markdown source files.

#### How to use it
We will define a `index.md` file:

```
# Hello World!

## This is a subheading.

An some content in markdown!
```

Then we will define our build step to optimize our images:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.md", "use": "@now/md" }
  ]
}
```

That's it. The result looks like this: https://markdown-deployment-bfc5zuwfx.now.sh

#### Technical Details
##### Entrypoint
The entrypoint is always an `.md` file you want to convert to HTML.
