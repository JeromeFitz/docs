## Errors

All API endpoints contain a `code` and `message` within the error responses, though some API endpoints extend the `error` object to contain other information. Each endpoint that does this will be documented in their appropriate section.

While we recommend that you write error messages that fit your needs and provide your users with the best experience, our `message` fields are designed to be neutral, not contain sensitive information, and can be safely passed down to user interfaces.

<Example>
<span>For example, the response for unauthorized requests:</span>
<Code>{`{
  "error": {
    "code": "forbidden",
    "message": "Not authorized"
  }
}`}</Code>
</Example>
