### URLs
A deployment is always associated with a unique URL, that has the following fundamental components:

- The deployment subdomain, made up of:
  - The deployment name
  - A UID
- The deployment suffix, which defaults to `now.sh` but is customizable with the [custom domain suffix add-on](/docs/v2/platform/add-ons#custom-deployment-suffix)

#### Subdomain
The subdomain can be at most `63` characters.

#### Deployment name
When a deployment is created, it must supply a `name`. If the user doesn't explicitly provide one, Now CLI will use the directory name.

The name can take up, at most, `53` characters. It is always followed by a dash `-`.

#### UID (Unique identifier)
The UID is derived from a large cryptographically random number encoded as 9 alphanumeric characters.

#### Suffix
The default suffix for all deployments is `now.sh`. It's registered with Mozilla's [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).

For enhanced isolation and security, we recommend configuring a [custom domain suffix](/docs/v2/platform/add-ons#custom-deployment-suffix).
