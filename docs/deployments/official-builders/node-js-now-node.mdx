### Node.js (@now/node)

The `@now/node` Builder takes an entrypoint of a Node.js function, builds its dependencies (if any) and bundles them into a [Lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

#### When to use it

This Builder is the recommended way to introduce any Node.js-based dynamic request handling into your codebases.

It can be used directly (as a single file, like `my-function.js`), or you can define an `index.js` file inside a directory.

#### How to use it

For this example, we will create a `cowsay` endpoint that we want to access as `my-deployment.url/api/cowsay`.

Let's create our project structure:

<TerminalInput>{`mkdir -p my-project/api/cowsay
cd my-project/api/cowsay`}</TerminalInput>

Inside `myproject > api > cowsay` we will create the following files:
- `index.js`
- `package.json`
- `yarn.lock`

To do so, let's run `yarn` to add our [`cowsay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay) module dependency:

<TerminalInput>yarn add cowsay</TerminalInput>

At this point, it is a good idea to define [a `.nowignore` file](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths) that contains:

```
node_modules
```

The `index.js` file exports a Node.js function that takes in the standard Node.js request and response objects:

```
const { parse } = require("url");
const cowsay = require("cowsay").say;
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { query } = parse(req.url, true);
  const { text = "Use query `text`" } = query;
  res.end(cowsay({ text }));
};
```

The only step left is to define a build that will take this directory's entrypoint (`index.js`), build it and turn it into a lambda:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/cowsay/index.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

Our resulting deployment is here: [https://myproject-k7hyuqhk9.now.sh](https://myproject-k7hyuqhk9.now.sh).

You can pass query parameters to make the cow change:

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint
The entrypoint of this Builder is always a JavaScript file that exposes a function. If you want to expose a server, look into `@now/node-server`, although that is not recommended.

##### Dependencies installation
The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

##### Private npm modules
To install private npm modules, define `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

##### Node.js version
The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.
