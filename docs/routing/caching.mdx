## Caching

The routing layer equates to the number of regions contained within the [**Basic CDN**](http://link-to-cdn-and-global-distribution). On every single one of those regions, we are able to cache your content using an LRU mechanism.

Whether you need to apply manual adjustments to your code in order for the responses to be cached depends on what kind of resources the **Builds** you defined are creating:

### Caching Static Files

There are no manual adjustments needed for caching **Static Files**. We set the `Cache-Control` header to `s-maxage=86400`, which ensures that the responses are cached for one day on all the regions within the **Basic CDN**.

### Caching Lambda Responses

In order to cache the response of a **Lambda** that was created by any of your **Builds**, you need to make sure to manually set the `Cache-Control` header and assign it a value that contains the `s-maxage` parameter (the equivalent of `max-age`, but for shared caches).

You can read more about the suggested way to define this property [here](http://link-to-global-routing-and-cdn).

### Sharding (sharding or sharing?)

By default, your cache is shared with all the other customers and behaves as an [LRU (Least Recently Used)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) mechanism.

If you would like for your cache to be shared, please [contact our Sales team](mailto:sales@zeit.co).
