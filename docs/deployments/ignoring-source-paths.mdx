## Ignoring Source Paths

We highly recommend including the file `.nowignore`. It is essential to deploying code to Now in a fast manner.

In this document, you will learn the file's exact function and how to use it.

### What Files Are Uploaded
By default, all files within your project are uploaded (not served, just uploaded) to Now.

In order to prevent a path within your project from being uploaded to Now, you need to create a `.nowignore` file and insert the path that you would like to ignore.

The syntax of that file is exactly the same as of a `.gitignore` file (you can find the full specification [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)). As an example, this is how `.nowignore` would have to look if you wanted to prevent the directories `node_modules` and `dist` from being uploaded:

```
node_modules
dist
```

We highly recommend taking advantage of this system for ignoring paths, as it will make creating deployments much faster (and cheaper).

### What Files Are Served
Only files that are matched by the `src` property of a **Build** are "considered for serving" (the **Builder** you defined decides whether a file is then actually served).

If you did not define a `now.json` file containing one or more **Builds**, however, all files within your project will be served.

The only **exceptions** are `now.json` and `.nowignore`, which will not be served if you did not explicitly define a **Build** with a `src` property that matches their names.
