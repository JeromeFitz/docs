### HTML Minifier (@now/html-minifier)

This builder optimizes `.html` files using [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).

#### When to use it

When you want your HTML source files to be minified so they are as small as possible (without any semantic changes) in production.

#### How to use it

We'll define a `index.html` file:

```
<!doctype html>
<h1>
  Hello
  there
  This is intentionally
        long
  </h1>
```

Then we'll define our build step to optimize our images:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/html-minifier" }
  ]
}
```

When we deploy with `now` and `curl` the resulting deployment URL, we will notice the HTML has been compressed:
```
â–²  curl https://optipng-deployment-f0hz0ny2d.now.sh/
<!doctype html><h1>Hello there This is intentionally long</h1>
```

##### Entrypoint
