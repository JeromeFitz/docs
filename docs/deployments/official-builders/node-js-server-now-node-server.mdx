### Node.js Server (@now/node-server)

<Note>We <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node">recommend using <InlineCode>@now/node</InlineCode></GenericLink> to best leverage Node.js in a serverless environment. This Builder is production-ready but should only be used by advanced users.</Note>

This Builder takes any Node.js [HTTP server](node-http-server) and wraps it inside a [lambda](lambda).

#### When to use it

To best take advantage of the [granularity of serverless](lambda-granularity), we recommend focusing on exposing function entrypoints to your APIs.

However, to ease the upgrade process to Now 2.0, porting over old non-serverless applications or testing out the system with an existing app, we created and maintain `@node/node-server`.

#### How to use it

Point `@now/node-server` to a file that opens a HTTP server that listens on a port.

In this example, we will set up an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) application and a vanilla HTTP server.

First, we will create two directories inside `my-project`

<TerminalInput>{`mkdir -p my-project/{node-http,express}`}</TerminalInput>

We will ensure `node_modules` are ignored with [`.nowignore`](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths):

```
node_modules
```

Inside `express`, we will set up and install a basic express server:

<TerminalInput>yarn add express</TerminalInput>

And `express/index.js` as follows:
```
const app = require('express')()
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from Express.js!');
})
app.listen();
```

Notice that `listen` does not receive a port, which means it can listen on an ephemeral port. `@now/node-server` works *with any port you listen on*.

We will do the same with `node-http/index.js`:

```
require("http")
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello from a vanilla server!");
  })
  .listen();
```

Finally we will configure a `now.json` that builds our directories concurrently to turn them into [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) that can be invoked on demand:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*/index.js", "use": "@now/node-server" }
  ]
}
```

As a result, our deployment will have two routes:
- `/express`
- `/node-server`

#### Technical Details

##### Entrypoint

The entrypoint is always a single file that when loaded via `require` opens **a single HTTP server port** where the main application listens.

##### Dependencies installation

The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

##### Private npm modules

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

##### Node.js version

The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.
